  * Using Dart 2 (required) by using the --preview-dart-2 flag
  * Wrapping your MaterialApp with the StoreProvider<State>,

  * Providing full type information to your Store<State>, 
  StoreProvider<State> and StoreConnector<State, ViewModel>
  * Ensure you are using consistent and complete imports. 
  E.g. always use `import 'package:my_app/app_state.dart';
